# Clock Drift Solutions for Celery Workers

## Overview
Clock drift warnings in Celery occur when there's a time synchronization issue between the worker and the Redis broker. This document outlines solutions implemented and additional recommendations.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Celery Configuration Updates
- Added time synchronization settings in `selenium_worker/config.py`
- Updated Celery app configuration in `selenium_worker/app.py` with:
  - Broker transport options for better connection handling
  - Worker settings to reduce memory/task limits
  - Time limits and tracking settings
  - Connection retry and keepalive options

### 2. Worker Startup Options
- Added `--without-gossip` to disable gossip protocol
- Added `--without-mingle` to reduce startup time
- Added `--without-heartbeat` to reduce clock sync dependencies

## Additional System-Level Solutions

### 3. Docker Time Synchronization (if using Docker)
Add to your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
volumes:
  - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
  - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
```

Or use host network mode:
```yaml
network_mode: "host"
```

### 4. System Clock Synchronization
Ensure NTP is running on your system:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ntp
sudo systemctl enable ntp
sudo systemctl start ntp

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install ntp
sudo systemctl enable ntpd
sudo systemctl start ntpd

# macOS
sudo sntp -sS time.apple.com
```

### 5. Redis Configuration
Add to your Redis configuration:
```
# redis.conf
tcp-keepalive 300
timeout 0
```

### 6. Environment Variables
Set these environment variables for better time handling:
```bash
export TZ=UTC
export CELERY_TIMEZONE=UTC
```

### 7. Monitoring and Debugging
To monitor clock drift:
```bash
# Check system time
date

# Check Redis time
redis-cli TIME

# Monitor Celery events
celery -A selenium_worker.app events --dump
```

## Expected Results
After implementing these changes:
- Clock drift warnings should be significantly reduced or eliminated
- Worker stability should improve
- Connection handling should be more robust
- Task processing should be more reliable

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check system logs for time synchronization errors
2. Verify Redis and worker are on the same timezone
3. Consider using a dedicated time server
4. Monitor network latency between worker and Redis
5. Check for virtualization-specific time issues
